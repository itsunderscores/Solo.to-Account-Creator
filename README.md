# Solo.to-Account-Creator
Automatically create solo.to accounts. I'll keep this short and simple.<br>

Requirements:<br>
  * TwoCaptcha

Instructions:<br>
  * Go to https://solo.to/register and get your cf_clearance cookie and replace PLACE_YOUR_CF_CLEARANCE_COOKIE_HERE on line 69<br>
  * Place your TwoCaptcha API Key on line 14<br>
  * Place accounts you want to create in usernames.txt (Accounts that get created are placed into "claimed.txt)<br>

I recommend using another checker to see if accounts are in use, and then using this to auto create them.
